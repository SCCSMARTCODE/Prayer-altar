   <h1> YOU CAN PRAY AND NOT GET ANSWERS, WHY?</h1>


<dl>
    <dt>#FACTOR1</dt>
    <dd>SIN</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course every believer knows that God doesn't listen 
to sinners, He loves sinners but cannot put up with their sins simply because 
He himself is a holy God,  holiness surrounds His dwelling. A preacher once define sin as 
"Satan's Identification Number" (S.I.N.) The scriptures is filled with passages that confirm that
 God detests sin and will not listen to sinners:
</p>
<ul>
<li>John 9 vs 31</li>
<li>Psalm 66 vs 18</li>
<li>Isaiah 59 vs 1-4; etc</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is a valid point and an unavoidable truth,
 then every wise prayer personage will do everything in his or her capacity to live a sin-free life .
  Why would you want to labour in vain? Let's break this down a bit. There are sub divisions under this topical issue. </p>
<ol>
<li> General sinners </li>
<li> Weakness </li>
<li> Mistake </li>
</ol>
<h2>
Let's holistically x-ray the above.
</h2>
<fieldset>
<legend>#Group1</legend> 
<h2>The general sinners </h2>
<p>These are the people who claim they are belivers
 because they go to church but basically their lifestyle is never consistent with the scriptures. 
  It is correct to frankly call them unbelievers. They do not have a single respect for God and His laws.
   If stealing comes they steal, if it is backbiting they're there, fornication they are masters, telling lies is their hubby,
    they can dance and jump up and shout "glorry" in the service but right inside the church, perversion and all sorts of atrocities 
    can be going on. They yield to any form of temptation easily, they come late to church,  they can dress provocatively,
     their mouth is filled with worldly slangs, in fact they are basically worldly, they oppose the teaching of IST JOHN 2 vs 15-17, 
     they can argue die just because they want to evade spiritual discipline and justify their compromise.... They commend the paths of compromise
      and talk of moderation even where the scriptures is strictly against this. They come to church on Sundays and club at weekends, they present 
      at both Christian gathering and worldly and ungodly gathering. They refuse to get out of the world and see themselves as chosen generation and peculiar people. 
      The Bible describes them as mixed multitudes in  EXODUS 12 vs 38. This set of people have filled the church today and have sullied the reputation of the body of christ. 
      This is our fault, we take delight in increasing our members without following "the protocol for admission." Yeah,  there is a protocol for admission,  
      as explained in ACTS 2 vs 37-42. It doesn't end at the altar call, read vs 41 and 42 well. If you are on this platform and you were admitted to the body of christ wrongly
       I believe Jesus loves you and He is offering you another opportunity, would you accept or decline? If you are in this group, praying to God may not work out well with you, 
       you simply need to be born again.... christ is calling 🔥 🔥 🔥 HEBREWS 3 vs 7-8 . We are moving into the second half of this year soon,  I want everyone on this platform
        to pray and breakthrough,  I want to hear mind blowing testimonies from you, may God help us in Jesus's name....🙏🙏.</p>

 <h2>WEAKNESS!</h2>
 <p>Let me take a deep breath here before I  continue. 
 This is a serious corner that requires daily attention and concerted efforts to overcome.
   This set contains people that are truly born again but still struggle with a particular sin.
    They have given their life to christ,  they are fervent in the spirit, serving the Lord,
      they keep the laws of God except one. Kaiya🔥, as sweet as they appear, there is a "but" in their life. 
      They are the one described in LUKE 18 vs 22. You can read the whole story line (LUKE 18 vs 18-27). 
      Scriptural examples are people like:
<ul>
<li>Judas iscariout( love of money),</li> 
<li>Gehazi(greed),</li> 
<li>Moses (uncontrolled anger),</li>
<li>Samson(fornication). Etc</li>
</ul>
<p>
These Generals are strong and passionate for God, they love God so dearly even
 more than most of us that claim we love God and give ourselves unnecessary titles🤦‍♂. But their
  weakness eventually got the best of them and their end wasn't pleasant 😭😭😭😭 

Can somebody stop and pray "God please help me, do not let my weakness get the best of me" 🔥 

Oh, you think Moses didn't do His best? Have you seen God face to face and talked with Him like friend?

Oh, the best definition you can give to Samson is a fornicator? How many great
 exploit have you carried out for christ in your family not to talk of your country?

Oh you felt Gehazi is just a stupid rapacious fellow right? Can the prophets of God select you to live with them and be their assistant?

Oh you felt Judas is just a scum? Ask yourself why he returned the money and committed suicide when he heard about the apprehension of christ? If it were you, 
won't you spend the money and continue life? Perhaps you have forgotten that he was on the street evangelising and healing the sick... have you ever preached christ openly in your life? 


In a nutshell, let's be guided and admit that these Generals were heroes who gave in their best but could not handle their weaknesses.
 .... now over to you and me. Following ROMANS 15 vs 4, how do we intend to handle our weaknesses before they swallow us?

You are fervent for christ and so I am but then, we both know there's still a corner of our lives not giving  glory to God. 
 It is high time we tackled this.  You come early to church, you are fervent,
  you keep all commandments except one, remember if you break one, you break all. This is a stage whereby you struggle hard yet,
   no way out.  You tried your best, countless times you cry, yet its like we gonna die together. This is the description in ROMANS 7 vs 15-25. 
   That's why it is called weakness.  See the way HEBREWS 12 vs 1 describes it. We can resist every other temptation but this particular one EASILY entangles us..... 
   This the devil uses as a weapon to weaken our prayer life and reduce the efficiency of our results. So most times we pray, we get answers,
    he (the devil) comes in the form of our weakness and steal the answers from us, thus we end up in wasted efforts having no testimony to share thus appearing like God does not answer prayer,
     a discouragement for others who want pray, exactly what the devil wants. Like that, the spiral continues 😭😭😭😭 what a painful experience 🤦‍♂.  The good news is this,
       with God all things are possible.  You can be out of this, I can be out of this. We will talk about the way out later. But then, 
take this 3 days fasting and prayers seriously.</p> </p>

<h2>MISTAKES</h2>
<p>
This is another category under the first factor "sin". The people here are recognised children of God
 and practical Christians who are doing just very well for God.  They have accomplished so much that they begin to feel 
 relaxed and comfortable. Their achievements get into their head and they see themselves as indomitable. 
 Subsequently, laxity will set in. They begin to miss prayer schedule and disrespect appointments with God. 
  Their laxity will get to a point that the devil will have opportunity to attack them. And they will find themselves defeated.
   No wonder the scriptures warned that we should not give the devil opportunity. A good example is David in 2nd SAMUEL 11 vs 1......
    at the time David should be at the battle front, he was chilling at home until he fell into the sin of adultery. Mind you, adultery wasn't his style,
     it was a mistake after which he repented he didn't go back to it. This is totally different from weakness, weakness will definitely reoccur. However,
      during this time, David prayed but God did not answer Him.


To be continued. .......
